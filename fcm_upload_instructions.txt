# How to Enable Push Notifications (FCM)

The server logs indicate that `serviceAccountKey.json` is missing. This file is required for Firebase Cloud Messaging (Push Notifications) to work.

## Steps to Fix

1.  **Locate the file**: Find your `serviceAccountKey.json` on your local machine. It should have been downloaded from the Firebase Console.

2.  **Upload to Server**: Use `scp` to copy it to the server. Run this command from your **local terminal**:

    ```bash
    scp /path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json root@152.53.87.200:/root/sniperterminal/serviceAccountKey.json
    ```

    *Replace `/path/to/your/` with the actual path on your computer.*

3.  **Restart the Server**:
    After uploading, log in to the server and restart the container:

    ```bash
    ssh root@152.53.87.200
    cd sniperterminal
    docker-compose restart sniper-backend
    ```

4.  **Verify**:
    Check the logs to ensure the error is gone:
    ```bash
    docker logs -f sniper-backend
    ```
